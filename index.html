              Yes. You can ask for how

              you need. And we don't

            <p>
              It’s good to budget for a
              domain name and for
              professional looking
              photos, if you don’t have
              them yet. A .com domain
              will go for around $10-20
              per year. And the
              photographer can vary a
              lot depending on your
              area and their level of
              expertise.

              Why don’t you just charge

            <p>
              We used to do that. But
              most clients benefit more
              from knowing that their
              website is always taken
              care of by an experienced
              person and that they
              don’t need to worry about
              dealing with any
              technical aspect of it.
              Besides, charging upfront
              often made the cost be an
              impediment for some small
              businesses that really
              needed our services.

              Although these platforms

              using them. All of our
              websites are 100%
              custom-coded and that's
              to so we can make it look

              You own the domain name

              Why is there a minimum

            </h3>
            <p>
              When your website goes
              live, you can already
              start seeing some
              results. But to get it to
              full speed and
              well-ranked on Google
              search results, it can
              take 6-24 months, since
              you’re competing with
              websites that have been
              around for years. So this
              minimum engagement is to
              give your website a
              chance to benefit you on
              the SEO aspect as well.
